There is a concept in the western world called a \"power weekend\u201c. Big projects are handled on the weekend when there is less traffic.

Make water/sewage pipes have a surface that can be opened when needed, so roads don\u2019t need to be dug up time and again. If an agency digs the road, it has to ensure it\u2018s repaired. 3. Ensure the wheel chair access is not used by motorists. 4. Widen roads. Most broad roads in Bangalore end up in tiny alleys!! 5. Use the best people for the project, don\u2019t go by least quoted amount, value quality.  6. Maintenance will decide how long the quality lasts. Ensure regular checks. 7. Be incorruptible.
